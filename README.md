👋 Hi, I’m @SupportPhillip, an aspiring IT professional and UX designer based in Tongaat, South Africa. Passionate about technology and currently delving into Network Defence Essentials Cybersecurity with the EC Council.

🌱 I’m currently learning the intricacies of Cybersecurity, having completed Google IT Support and Digital Skills: User Experience courses. My journey includes a UX/UI Design internship with Alfido Tech, where I designed a mobile app sign-up page, email template, and landing page.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on exciting tech projects, especially those involving user-centric design and cybersecurity.
